        An "Arrow Fade Out No Scroll" effect is a visual cue often used on websites to enhance user experience. This feature typically involves an arrow icon placed near the bottom of a section, such as a hero image or landing page. Initially, the arrow is fully visible, guiding users to scroll down for more content. As the user begins to scroll, the arrow gradually fades out, becoming completely invisible after a short distance. This fade-out effect is smooth and non-intrusive, ensuring it doesn't distract users while still serving as an initial navigational hint. The "no scroll" aspect means the arrow remains fixed in place rather than scrolling with the page, emphasizing its role as a subtle, temporary guide. This design element enhances usability without cluttering the interface.
